# HeroForge Pre-Seed Investor Strategy 2025

**Document Version:** 2.0
**Last Updated:** December 31, 2025
**Status:** Pre-Seed Fundraising Document

---

## Executive Summary

HeroForge is a mission-driven cybersecurity platform built by a **20-year Signals Intelligence Analyst** who operated at the nation-state level against targets worldwide. As a **100% disabled Army veteran and father**, I'm building the tool I wish existed: affordable, comprehensive security testing for everyone—not just Fortune 500 companies.

**Current Status:**
- Pre-revenue (tested twice against same target)
- ~90% feature-complete after 3 weeks of AI-assisted development
- Seeking first 100 users for validation
- Solo founder, seeking advisors

**The Mission:** Make American security architecture affordable. Security is a right, not a luxury.

**The Ask:** $500K-$1.5M pre-seed to:
1. Complete product validation (first 100 users)
2. Achieve first revenue ($200K ARR Year 1)
3. Build founding team (2-3 technical co-founders/early hires)

## 1. Founder Story

### Who I Am

**20 Years of Signals Intelligence Analysis**
- Operated at nation-state level against targets worldwide
- Specialized in offensive cyber operations and network reconnaissance
- Hands-on experience with tools and techniques now in HeroForge

**100% Disabled Army Veteran**
- Retired with full disability
- Father trying to build something meaningful
- Mission: democratize security, make it affordable for everyone

### Why I Built This

For two decades, I watched enterprise security tools become increasingly expensive and exclusive. Small businesses, consultancies, and security researchers are priced out of the market. Tenable costs $2,275/year for 65 assets. Qualys requires enterprise contracts. The best tools are reserved for those who can afford them.

**I believe security is a right, not a luxury.**

So I built HeroForge in 3 weeks with AI assistance—an all-in-one platform that does what $50K worth of enterprise tools do, for $999/year.

### What Makes This Different

**Not another VC-backed startup chasing ARR:**
- I'm a practitioner who spent 20 years doing this work
- I know what pentesters need because I've been there
- I'm not optimizing for exit—I'm optimizing for impact
- This is personal: affordable security for the people who need it most

**Speed as competitive advantage:**
- Built in 3 weeks what takes VC-backed teams 18 months
- No committee decisions, no bureaucracy
- Solo founder = fastest iteration cycles in the industry

---

## 2. The Problem

### The Market Gap

**Enterprises have options (expensive):**
- Tenable: $2,275/year for 65 assets
- Qualys: Enterprise contracts only
- Rapid7: $175/month per app
- Traditional pentesting: $5K-$100K per engagement

**Everyone else gets:**
- Free tools (OpenVAS, Nmap) with no support, manual reporting, no AI
- DIY solutions cobbled together from 5+ different tools
- Annual pentests they can't afford

**The result:** 80% of small businesses have zero security testing capability.

### Who's Underserved

1. **Freelance pentesters** - Need client deliverables, can't afford enterprise tools
2. **Small consultancies** - 2-10 person teams doing security assessments
3. **Startups** - Pre-Series A companies needing SOC2/compliance on a budget
4. **MSPs** - Managed service providers wanting to add security services
5. **Security researchers** - Bug bounty hunters, vulnerability researchers
6. **Non-profits/Government** - Mission-critical but budget-constrained

**Market size:** 100,000+ freelancers, 15,000+ small consultancies globally

## 8. Risk Mitigation

### Key Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| **Solo founder risk** | Actively seeking technical co-founders and advisors; using AI to 10x productivity; building in public for accountability |
| **Product validation** | Free tier for user feedback; quick iteration cycles; direct engagement with early users; willingness to pivot |
| **Competition (Terra, Tenable)** | Serve underserved SMB market they ignore; veteran founder story; mission-driven vs profit-driven; speed advantage |
| **Technical scalability** | Built on Rust (high performance); cloud-native architecture; started with scalability in mind |
| **Go-to-market execution** | Organic community-first approach (low burn); founder has domain expertise to create authentic content |
| **Regulatory/Compliance** | SOC2 in roadmap; using HeroForge to pentest itself; conservative approach to security claims |

### Founder Strengths

**Why I'll succeed where others fail:**

1. **Domain expertise:** 20 years of hands-on SIGINT/pentesting
2. **Product intuition:** I'm the target customer
3. **Rapid iteration:** Solo founder, no committee decisions
4. **Mission alignment:** Not chasing exit, chasing impact
5. **Veteran discipline:** Mission planning, execution, resilience
6. **AI leverage:** Built in 3 weeks what takes teams 18 months
7. **Community credibility:** Veteran + practitioner = instant trust

## Conclusion

### Why HeroForge Will Win

**This isn't a typical VC pitch.**

I'm not a 24-year-old Stanford grad with a deck and a dream. I'm a **20-year veteran of nation-state cyber operations** who built a comprehensive security platform in 3 weeks because I was tired of watching security become a luxury good.

**The opportunity:**
- $2.4B pentesting market
- 100,000+ underserved freelancers and consultancies
- AI enabling solo founders to compete with $30M startups
- Veteran founder credibility in cybersecurity space

**The product:**
- 90% functional after 3 weeks
- 8 modules that competitors took years to build
- $999/year vs $50K+ enterprise equivalent
- Built by a practitioner for practitioners

**The mission:**
- Security is a right, not a luxury
- Democratize access to world-class security tools
- Prove that veteran founders can move at Silicon Valley speed
- Build something meaningful, not just profitable

**The ask:**
- $500K-$1.5M to get to $200K-$1.2M ARR
- Partner who believes in the mission
- Advisor network to help scale

**I don't need $30M and 25 employees. I need $500K and 18 months to prove that affordable, comprehensive security is possible.**

Security shouldn't be reserved for those who can afford it. Let's fix that.
