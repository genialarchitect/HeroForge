# HeroForge Acceptable Use Policy

**Last Updated:** December 24, 2024

## Purpose

This Acceptable Use Policy ("AUP") defines the acceptable and prohibited uses of the HeroForge security assessment platform. This policy is designed to protect HeroForge, our users, and the broader internet community from irresponsible or illegal use of security testing tools.

**Violation of this policy may result in immediate account termination and potential legal action.**

## 1. Fundamental Requirement: AUTHORIZATION

### 1.1 The Golden Rule
**YOU MUST HAVE EXPLICIT, WRITTEN AUTHORIZATION BEFORE SCANNING ANY SYSTEM.**

This is not optional. This is not negotiable. Unauthorized scanning is illegal in most jurisdictions and violates our Terms of Service.

### 1.2 What Constitutes Valid Authorization
Valid authorization must be:
- **Written:** Documented in writing (email, contract, or formal letter)
- **Explicit:** Clearly states permission to perform security testing
- **Specific:** Identifies the systems, networks, or applications covered
- **Current:** Valid for the time period of testing
- **From an authorized person:** Someone with authority to grant permission

### 1.3 Examples of Valid Authorization
- Signed penetration testing agreement with client
- Written authorization from system owner/administrator
- Bug bounty program terms that explicitly permit your testing
- Your own systems that you own and control
- Lab/test environments specifically designated for security testing

### 1.4 Authorization Documentation
You must maintain records of authorization for:
- Minimum of 3 years after testing
- All systems scanned using HeroForge
- Available upon request for audit purposes
