## 1. Founding Principles

### Community Over Customers

**Philosophy:** Treat early users as partners, not transactions
- Share roadmap publicly
- Take feature requests seriously
- Give credit where it's due (name them in release notes)
- Build in public (share wins and losses on Twitter)

### Authentic Over Polished

**Philosophy:** Leverage veteran founder story and practitioner credibility
- Don't pretend to be a big company
- Be honest: "Solo founder, built in 3 weeks with AI"
- Show the journey: bugs, fixes, learning
- InfoSec community values authenticity

### Free Value First

**Philosophy:** Give away 90% of value for free, charge for convenience
- Free tier: Full scanning capabilities, unlimited scans
- Paid tier: PDF reports, customer portal, CRM, collaboration
- Free users become evangelists if you solve their problem

**Title:** "I'm a 20-year SIGINT analyst. I built a comprehensive pentesting platform in 3 weeks with AI. Here's what I learned."

**Content structure:**
```
[Opening: Who I am]
- 20 years Signals Intelligence
- 100% disabled Army veteran
- Father, mission-driven

[Problem: Why I built this]

- All-in-one pentesting platform
- Network, web app, cloud, container security
- Built in 3 weeks with Claude Code (AI pair programming)

[Tech stack]
- Backend: Rust, Tokio, Actix-web
- Frontend: React, TypeScript, Vite
- Database: SQLite with optional encryption

[Lessons learned]
- AI lets solo founders move at VC-backed startup speed
- Domain expertise > engineering background
- Building in public creates accountability

[The ask]
- Looking for 100 beta users

## 9. What NOT to Do (Solo Founder Traps)

**Don't:**
1. ❌ Hire too early (stay lean until $10K MRR minimum)
2. ❌ Spend on paid ads (organic only until you prove conversion)
3. ❌ Build features users don't request (talk to customers daily)
4. ❌ Optimize for scale before finding product-market fit
5. ❌ Chase enterprise deals (SMB/consultancies easier to close)
6. ❌ Ignore negative feedback (it's the most valuable)
7. ❌ Overthink branding/design (ship fast, iterate)
8. ❌ Try to compete with VC-backed startups on their terms (be different)

**Do:**
1. ✅ Talk to users every single day (Zoom, Slack, email)
2. ✅ Ship code daily (small improvements > big releases)
3. ✅ Build in public (transparency builds trust)
4. ✅ Leverage veteran story (it's your unfair advantage)
5. ✅ Use AI to 10x productivity (Claude Code, GitHub Copilot)
6. ✅ Focus on one acquisition channel at a time
7. ✅ Celebrate small wins (first $1, first $1K MRR, first customer win)
8. ✅ Take care of yourself (you're in this for 18+ months minimum)

## Conclusion

**This is not a typical GTM playbook.** There are no sales teams, no ad budgets, no enterprise ABM campaigns.

This is grassroots. This is authentic. This is a solo founder with domain expertise, military discipline, and AI leverage going head-to-head with $30M startups.

**The advantage:**
- You're faster (no committees)
- You're cheaper (no burn rate)
- You're authentic (veteran founder story)
- You're credible (20 years SIGINT)

**The plan:**
- Month 1: 10 beta users
- Month 2: 50 free signups
- Month 3: 10 paying customers
- Month 4: 50 paying customers
- Month 5: 75 paying customers
- Month 6: 100 paying customers, $10K MRR

**Then you fundraise from a position of strength.**

Security is a right, not a luxury. Let's make it accessible to everyone.
